jPlus
======

jPlus is a lightweight, easy to use, slightly responsive image slideshow plugin with built in lightbox for use with jQuery. It comes with buttons to go back and forth between images, a simple "bullet"-navigation for image control and a +... just like the name - used to show a bigger version of your image.

All you need to use it is a little basic HTML and CSS know-how.
